# I. Quiz

Answer the below questions using at least 3 sentences. This is open book. You may write the answers below the questions.

1. What is garbage collection?
the way python deletes unused objects is called garbage collection. In garbage collection, Python first finds unused space to free up. Then it reclaims those spaces to be reused.
2. What does it mean to say that python is a dynamic language?
There are two types. Dynamic typing and static typing. By saying python is a dynamic language is impliying that python uses dynamic typing. Dynamic typing is a more efficient, faster type, but this can lead to shared refrences and some other things lke that. Static typing is a more strict, organized way of typing but it can be hard to remember all the object's address.
3. What are some basic object types in python?
One type is Integers. Another type is Floating-Point Numbers. Another type is Complex numbers.
4. What does it mean to  an 'in place' change to an object?
An in-place change to an object is when you edit the object directly. You do not create a duplicate of the object or use shared refrences. This doesn't work with inmutible objects.
5. What are some of python's built in types? Why is it cool that python has built in types?
some of pythons built in types are int, float, and complex. This is useful so that you do not need to create everything from scratch. Also it is quicker and can make stuff easier.
6. What is the difference between a name/variable, a reference, and an object?
The varible is like the name. The refrence is what the varible refers to. The object is what the varible is refering to.
7. What is mutability?
Mutability means that you can change an object in python. Inmutibility means you cannot change that object in python. Mutibility is useful if you want to change something like an string or a list quickly.
8. Name 2 mutable types and 2 immutable types in python.
Strings and lists are mutible. Most of pythons built in types are inmutible. These include integers and complex numbers.
